# AI-Connect-Four
Built an AI-driven Connect 4 application featuring a minimax-based engine enhanced with heuristics to evaluate board states, anticipate player actions, and choose the strongest available move. The project includes full game logic, win detection, and a smooth user experience where players face an algorithm capable of multi-step planning.
